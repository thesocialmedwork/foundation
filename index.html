	          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Our How</h2>
	          <p class="lead"><span class="brand">The Social <span>Med</span>work Foundation</span> is committed to developing and implementing our mission with the highest moral and ethical standards of philanthropy. The foundation funding will be made possible through the various steps:</p>
			  <ul class="list-group">
				  <li class="list-group-item">Global buyers club <span class="brand">The Social <span>Med</span>work</span> will allocate an amount of income to
<span class="brand">The Social <span>Med</span>work</span> Foundation’s capital</li>
				  <li class="list-group-item">Subsidies, gifts and donations to <span class="brand">The Social <span>Med</span>work</span> Foundation</li>
				  <li class="list-group-item">Legacies, succession or other payments to <span class="brand">The Social <span>Med</span>work Foundation</span></li>
				  <li class="list-group-item">Yields from various social activities</li>
				  <li class="list-group-item">That which has been obtained in any other legal way, whether or not in accordance with
any agreement concluded by the foundation.</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
				<p class="lead"><span class="brand">The Social <span>Med</span>work Foundation</span> will be operated by an independent executing team, while relying on the network and systems of <span class="brand">The Social <span>Med</span>work</span> buyers club. Applications will be reviewed and approved by <span class="brand">The Social <span>Med</span>work Foundation</span> Medical Ethical Advisory Board.</p>
	        </div>

	        <div class="col-md-7">
	          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Our Do</h2>
	          <p class="lead">As part one of our mission, a patient with very limited means and who may be experiencing social environmental barriers anywhere in the world, from the suburbs of Denver to Berlin, or to the townships of Capetown, can find a treatment through our community marketplace, that has not (yet) been reimbursed by their healthcare system. This patient can apply to <span class="brand">The Social <span>Med</span>work</span> Foundation with a request to subsidize their treatment. <span class="brand">The Social <span>Med</span>work Foundation</span> Medical Ethical Advisory Board will then perform a financial eligibility assessment for this product based on the patient’s annual income, assets and expenditure levels. Based on the outcome of this assessment, <span class="brand">The Social <span>Med</span>work Foundation</span> may decide to subsidize the treatment up to maximum of 50% of the annual costs.</p>
			  <p class="lead">From 2013 - 2016, the West African Ebola virus epidemic was the most widespread outbreak of Ebola virus disease in history. This ignited part two of our mission, as <span class="brand">The Social <span>Med</span>work</span> Foundation believes that the mortality rate could have been significantly reduced within the first few months of the devastating outbreak. A combination of early diagnosis and off-label use of otherwise approved and well-tolerated antiviral drugs (e.g. favipiravir), would have had the potential to save many lives. Moreover, pre-exposure prophylaxis of health care workers, and post-exposure prophylaxis of family members with experimental anti-viral drugs would have reduced the reproduction number significantly by December 2014. <span class="brand">The Social <span>Med</span>work</span> Foundation will take rapid action in response to crisis situations by responding with creativity and tenacity to avoid unnecessary suffering in such contagious and community threatening circumstances.</p>
